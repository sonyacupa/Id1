             <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
                <h3>Wine is fun for everyone. It's not all about fine dining and fancy food. It's about bringing everyone together and having fun. These are 3 facts that are fun to know. Tell your friends and family. They will be impressed.</h3>
                            <h2>1. Wine Names Indicated by Location or Grape</h2>
            <img src="images/fun-names.png" id="names">    
            <p>Most European wines are named after their geographical origin. One very famous example would be the Bordeaux wine which is produced in the Bordeaux region of France. Bordeaux wines are made of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and to a much lesser extent Carmenere and Malbec.

<p> Non-European wines almost always have the name of the grape (aka the varietal) on the label - for instance Cabernet Sauvignon from California.</p>
                
<h2>2. Tasting is an Experience, Not just the Wine</h2>
  
            <p>In 2001, a panel of wine experts gave one of the lowest possible scores to an average-priced Bordeaux that was served in a cheap bottle. When it was served in an expensive bottle, it received one of the highest possible scores.</p>
                                
<h2>3. Ancient Times Wine Beliefs</h2>
  
            <p>Ancient Egyptian kings avoided wine because of its resemblance to blood. They believed that it was the blood of those who battled the gods and lost and that it was the reason why drinking wine temporarily drove people out of their senses and made them a little crazy</p>
