    <!----Wireframe---->
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Wireframe</h4>
            <!----Below, describe your process creating your wireframe. How did the content of your essay inform the hierarchy of your wireframe?---->
            <img src="images/wireframe.jpg" width="80%" alt="first wireframe">
            <img src="images/visual%20map.jpg" width="80%" alt="second wireframe">
            <p>The wireframe was something familar to me ounce I started working with DigitalWave. I realize that it's important to do desktop and mobile since it's different on two platforms. The hierachy is the most importat with big images and big headline.</p>
            <!----moodborads---->
        <li><h4>Moodboards</h4>
            <!----Below, describe your process creating your moodboards. In the next project, what would you do differently?---->
            <img src="images/wine1.jpg" width="80%" alt="wine1">
            <p>I had a feeling for my website. This was made from a previous class that was a printed ad campaign. I wanted to use the same sloppy and fun wine feeling.</p>

        <li><h4>Production</h4>
            Project 3:<a href="/index.html"> Wine Month</a>
            <!----Below, describe your process of translating your wireframe & moodboards into HTML + CSS. What did you find easy & straightforward? What did you find frustrating?---->
            <p>What I found easy was placing text and images. The content was the easy to gather, but ounce I started laying out, I found the navigation difficult. I spent the most time in CSS. I also found that trying to break them into two frames would take me longer. I decided to have a one column.</p>
                <!----production---->
        <li><h4>Final Takeaways</h4>
    <!----Finally, list any takeaways from Project 3. For future HTML & CSS projects, what would you do differently? What would you keep the same?---->
            <p>What I would do differently is to spend more time working on a two column frame. I would keep the image that had text ontop. The was fun to figure out. I also would keep the navigation flushed to the right. I learned that it's important to map out everything before going in and start coding. Planning is important. </p>
