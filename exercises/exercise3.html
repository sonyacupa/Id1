    <ol>
        <!-------------QUESTION 1---------------------->
        <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
        <p>Pitchfork feature story on Janelle Monae is delightful and playful. The story and visuals shows off her inner personality asides from her strong music. Starting with the fonts, It's bright a bold san serifs in beginning. When scrolling down the page, the font changes to serifs and playing off the quotes in italics. It's bold and feminine-like feel, but her music has bold tones to it.</p>
        <!-------------QUESTION 2---------------------->
        <li><strong>Describe the color palette. Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
        <p>The beginning is a strong reds with white and black. The body color palettes are light greens and off-white throughout the site. Pinks and yellows are in the middle of the site. At the end, black and white indicate the end of the page as if found in end credits in movies. I wish to see more reds thorughout the site.</p>
        <!-------------QUESTION 3---------------------->
        <li><strong>What role do the visuals play?</strong></li>
        <p>The visuals of Monae are complimentary to the text and color palette. The photos don't play a significant role. The photos are medium to tight shots. She only looks at the viewer ounce.</p>
        <!-------------QUESTION 4---------------------->
        <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
        <p>The sections are saperated with header, color blocks with text and pull quotes. What's great about the writing features is that it's nicely section with green, then pink tones. It's simple and easily blocks with square and rectangle shapes.</p>
