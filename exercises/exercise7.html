            <li><h3>Describe how the navigation for this "story" works.</h3></li>
            <p>The navigation is simple and has a blog form. It can easily be read by anyone because of the bold all caps. It also has a great mobile view as well</p>
            <li><h3>How does the ending for Chapter 3 differ from the endings for the other 2 chapters?</h3></li>
            <p>The ending is a CTA rather than another text. If someone were to follow it as a story, it gives the person to click on it naturally than as a seperate block</p>
