        <!-------------QUESTION 1---------------------->
        <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
        <p>The Daft Punk feature story has unique with many of its elements to tell their story. The photos in the header that reads, "Machines for Life." Only shows up ounce and its a written header. While the rest are all caps in the beginning of each page and serifs. The pull quotes switch from zeros as if it's computerized, which I believe is annoying. The style of it works for the artist, but hard to read.</p>
        <!-------------QUESTION 2---------------------->
        <li><strong>Describe the color palette. Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
        <p>The main color are deep blues, light blues, yellow and reds. Mostly the colors are used as background and transitions.</p>
        <!-------------QUESTION 3---------------------->
        <li><strong>What role do the visuals play?</strong></li>
        <p>The visuals are fun. The pictures are more of a background, but the fire that is thorughout the page helps excites the page. The previous photos are only gifs with moving heads, but the flame keeps it exciting.</p>
        <!-------------QUESTION 4---------------------->
        <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
        <p>The sections are separated by blocks of color, which I feel like picthfork does with others. What is interesting is with pull quotes comes out on the right hand side. It's something I haven't seen in previous ounce. It also transitions a stary night</p>
