        <h3>About Me - Tell me about your path to becoming a designer.</h3>
        <p>My journey as a web designer just began right after Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January. I don't have web experience even a complete web design degree, but I do have skills that got to where I am today.</p>

<p>For four years, I was a multimedia journalist. I uncovered in depth stories of the average joe with photography and film. I love getting to know someone. I was not in love with breaking news. I wanted to fix people I cared, but I could only be an observer.</p>

<p>I left my job and was in search for something new. I put away my camera for almost a year and served coffee as a barista. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I enjoyed creating drinks in it's simple form. I love writing down the codes and remembering what is in it. I didn't know I was learning to design on the spot.</p>

<p>I went back to school and started taking classes again. It was instant love. All the research, the designing made me feel like I'm working for the greater good. I didn't feel like I was observing, but helping. Ultimately, I envision myself to be a UX designer.</p>

<p>I want to reconstruct something that is broken. I want to research to making something better. I want to be someone who can be there and connect with them in someway.</p>

<p> know relearning a new skill is scary, but I know that if your dreams don't scare you, you're not dreaming big enough. Oh it scares me, and I can't wait to get into the thick of it.</p>
        <h3>About Me - Tell me what you hope to accomplish with design</h3>
        <p>What I hope to accomplish with design is design with a purpose. I've always been into fixing something or making something better. I hope to work on social justice, immigration and women empowerment.</p>
