        <li><h4>Wireframe</h4>
    <!----Below, describe your process creating your wireframe. How did the content of your essay inform the hierarchy of your wireframe?---->

    <p>This is my second wireframe sketch. My first one had three columns. I was confused at first, but after the critique, I made changes to it. I felt the hierachy of the wireframe is something similar to pitchfork withought giant images through the body. I kept it simple with a large gif to indicate movement of the artists. I floated the profile to the left to show the reader an introudction of the artists. The video was large to indicated importance. </p>

                <li><h4>Moodboards</h4>
    <!----Below, describe your process creating your moodboards. In the next project, what would you do differently?---->

    <p>The moodboards activity was a great exercise. I've had Pinterest for a few years and heard many artists and designers used it to pull of inspiration. I was able to use my saved images to make a moonboard less than 30 min. I wanted to create two different moodboards my showcasing two sides of my artists. One that is strong with color and another with gray tones. For my next project, I want to create three moodboards for variety and indicate which one is my main color and accent colors. </p></li>

        <li><h4>Production</h4>
           Project 1:<a href="index.html"> Lindsey Stirling</a>
    <!----Below, describe your process of translating your wireframe & moodboards into HTML + CSS. What did you find easy & straightforward? What did you find frustrating?---->
   
    <p>The process from wireframe, moodboard to HTML + CSS was straight forward. I understand the workflow and really googling many things to figureout what I needed to do. What was easy is centering text and float photos. I had a difficult time with padding qutoe to the left. I decided to leave it off. What was also difficult was figuring out why my index.htmls were overrighting, which took most of my time.</p></li>

        <li><h4>Final Takeaways</h4>
    <!----Finally, list any takeaways from Project 1. For future HTML & CSS projects, what would you do differently? What would you keep the same?---->
    <p>Project 1 was fun and it gave my the fundementals to move forward. I admit, the site looks like what I would find on Angelfire, but I'm still proud of it. For future projects, I want to learn how to section my paragraphs. I also want to spend more time asking advice from my classmates.
